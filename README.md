Repository for the audio component of my final project.

I'm planning to edit a song so that when the character's in the animation presses a button, a new part of the song plays, changing the colors on the screen as well as
the character's emotions (ex. red=angry, blue=sad). There isn't really a deeper meaning here, we just thought it would be cool and wanted to have fun with 
our final project.

1. "Sound & Color," Alabama Shakes, 2015, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faG8RiaANek. I am using this song under Fair Use because 1) I am using it for non-profit purposes, 2) I am only using the first minute or so and have edited it by changing the pitch at certain parts, reversing parts of it, and making use of cuts, and 3) I do not forsee my use having significant (if any) effect on the original work's value.
2. "Bike Magical Bell" (Bell sound), downloaded from Mixkit, commercial license for free use
3. "Walking" (footsteps sound), recorded by me, Ella Grant

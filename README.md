# Introduction
In our animation, we wanted to show the different colors of the rainbow, with each having a represenative meaning. Many of these are associated with human emotion, and the animation follows a woman as she grapples with the emotions in her life.

# Reflection
For this project, I participated in the graphic part of the animation. I matched the frames with the audio so that the transitions for the drawings reflect the changes in color/emotions (and beat drops). As stated earlier, there was not initially a deeper meaning behind the colors besides reflection the woman's emotions, but I think the viewers can interpret why she is going through these emotions, and what is the outcome. 

After drawing the frames, I added some sound effects such as a pencil drawing and camera sound to further immerse the viewers in the audio/visuals. I did stray from the original idea of pressing buttons because the animation developed an interpretive meaning further along, and I found a way to transition between scenes using the previous frames (ex: orange wedge to sun) much more smoothly. 

After finishing the animation, I wanted to bring it to life with dynamic color transitions in After Effects. I downloaded some video templates online and layered them (layer style: ilhouette luma) with the respective color (layer style: add). I scaled and repositioned some of the video clips so that they would spread out from a specific part of the frame. For the ending (rainbow), I added (layers style: overlay) over an ink splash clip so to symbolize the explosive expression of color and emotions.
